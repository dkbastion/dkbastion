            <h2>ðŸŽ­ How Stage and Production Management Experience Helps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear Communication Under Pressure:</strong> Stage managers relay complex info calmly and
                    preciselyâ€”just like effective technical writers.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Coordination:</strong> Managing people, gear, and timelines on a show translates
                    directly into cross-team writing projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Audience Awareness:</strong> Theater teaches you to think from the audience's point of
                    viewâ€”essential for user-focused docs.</li>
                <li><strong>Step-by-Step Thinking:</strong> Cue calling is just like writing procedures: every step must
                    be accurate, testable, and in order.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Problem Solving:</strong> When things go wrong live, you fix them. That same
                    mindset helps tackle vague specs and shifting goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Storytelling and Flow:</strong> A background in script analysis helps structure content
                    that's logical, smooth, and engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> Understanding how all parts of a show interact mirrors
                    understanding complex tech ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>ðŸŽ“ How a Theater Degree Enhances Technical Writing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> Theater hones clarity, impact, and intention in
                    communicationâ€”perfect for technical content.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Structure:</strong> Knowing how to build a story helps you organize documentation
                    with flow and logic.</li>
                <li><strong>User Empathy:</strong> Theater cultivates empathyâ€”great for anticipating user needs,
                    questions, and confusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Theater grads thrive in teamsâ€”just like the best tech writers who
                    work across disciplines.</li>
                <li><strong>Deadline Discipline:</strong> The show must go onâ€”on time. That production mentality carries
                    over into documentation delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Constraints:</strong> Theater teaches how to solve big problems with limited time
                    and resourcesâ€”just like in tech.</li>
                <li><strong>Multidisciplinary Thinking:</strong> Theater degrees often include lighting, design, tech,
                    and literatureâ€”perfect for a well-rounded writer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>âœ… Summary</h2>
            <p>
                My theater education and stage management background give me a unique lens in tech writingâ€”combining
                empathy, precision, structure, and calm under pressure.
                I don't just write manualsâ€”I design user experiences with words.
